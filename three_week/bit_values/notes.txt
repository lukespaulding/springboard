Step One: 
    I identified that the pattern here was that it was primes! I brute forced my way to the result, and ended up at 31.

Step Two:
    By toggling the third bit, we are turning it off and on. The count shortened by the number that we can expect from a bit 3, which is 8.

Step Three: 
    We cleared 7 which shorted it by the amount that the 7th bit provides, just like when we toggled 3. 

Step Four: 
    I used a for loop to clear the range of bits. This shortened our value massively, as we removed the top half, which contained the majority of the bits.
